# About Binflash
Binflash is a collection of tools you may use in order to flash your DVD burner with a binary firmware file (most executable flashers are also supported) or to dump the Flash ROM of your burner back to disc. You should be able to work with all devices that are currently accessible in your operating system, even if the drives are attached via Firewire or USB. There have been reports about some external enclosures that do not support sending all commands needed for a successful flash to the drive. Using the flaher in this case can lead to unpredictable results. Furthermore some Windows IDE drivers and some Linux kernel versions are known to cause trouble. So please use the original Microsoft IDE drivers or start the flasher with root user when running from Linux

This flasher is in no way supported by the manufacturers and we cannot guarantee that this program works as expected.

# Documentation
Depending on the manufacturer dependant version of Binflash, not all options may be available for you.

| Option | Function |
| - | - |
| -scan |Scan your IDE-/SCSI/Firewire/USB-adapters for supported devices. Depending on the manufacturer your version of Binflash was written for, some drives may be listed which are not supported. |
| -dump |This option lets you dump the current firmware back to disc if supported. You need to specify a filename that will be used for dumping the firmware and the name of the device you want to use. |
| -flash |If you want to flash your drive with a new firmware, you need to specify this option. Furthermore the name of your firmware file and the device are needed in order to flash your drive. |
| -querybt |Query current booktype settings. The program will display the current disctype, the booktype of the disc and the drive's current booktype settings |
| -setbt |This command lets you change the booktype settings of your drive. You can change the default booktype for DVD+R, DVD+R-DL and DVD+RW to a different setting. Depending on your firmware version not all kind of discs can be changed. Neither do older firmwares with bitsetting based on Ricoh commands support temporary changes |
| -setbtrw |You can change the booktype of a currently inserted DVD+RW to any other value. This function is not supported by newer firmwares |
| -clearbt | In newer firmwares the number of supported booktype changes is limited to 500. If you want to reset this value because you have made 500 changes already, you should try using this option. By calling -clearbt not only the counter is reset, but all booktype settings are restored to default as well. |
| -version | Displays some version information. This is important if something is not working the way it should. Support can only be given if the version numbers are supplied |
| -identify |Used for retrieving data about unknown drives that is required for adding support to Binflash |
| -queryrpc |Displays the current DVD region settings |
| -resetrpc |This command is used to reset the DVD region counter. You can either issue a vendor reset or you can completely reset the region counter, giving 4 vendor and 5 user changes. It is recommended to use auto-reset or RPC1 firmwares instead. |

## Example on using Binflash

First of all scan your adapters for valid devices:

_C:\>**necflash -scan**_

This may lead to an output similar to:

    Binflash - NEC version - (C) by Liggy and Herrie
    Visit http://binflash.cdfreaks.com

    List of supported devices:
    Device   : 1.0.0
    Vendor   : _NEC
    Model    : DVD_RW ND-2500A
    Firmware : 1.07

Now you should backup your current firmware by issueing the following command, using the device that you got during the device scan:

_C:\>**necflash -dump C:\OldFirmware.bin 1.0.0**_

After accepting the disclaimer and waiting for a few seconds you will get the file C:\OldFirmware.bin which contains your current firmware.


Now you probably want to update your drive with a new firmware. You can do so simply by calling the following command:

_C:\>**necflash -flash C:\NewFirmware.bin 1.0.0**_

If you accept the disclaimer and wait for a few seconds again, the burner is updated with the firmware from C:\NewFirmware.bin


The following command is used to set the default booktype for DVD+R to DVD-ROM:

_C:\>**necflash -setbt DVD+R DVD-ROM perm 1.0.0**_

For **DVD+R**, **DVD+RW** and **DVD+R-DL** you can set the booktype to **DVD-ROM**, **DVD-R**, **DVD-RW**, **DVD+R**, **DVD+RW** and **DVD+R-DL**. Instead of using **perm** you may also use **temp** if you just want to use the temporary settings that only last until the next drive reset. (This feature is not supported by every firmware)

# Build
## Prerequisites
Last successful Windows build was done using Visual Studio 2010. More recent versions may require changes to the code or the project files.

Despite throwing some warning, Binflash on Linux still seems to compile with GCC version 8.3 successfully.

The DOS version requires [DJGPP](http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/) setup on your machine

The Mac version was built with XCode 3.2.4 on MacOS 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard). Using recent versions will probably require some work.

## Instructions
On Windows you just open the solution file (binflash.sln) with Visual Studio and build the release you like to have. Choosing target "Oldrelease" should build a version that is compatible with Windows 2000.

The Linux, DOS and Mac versions are generated with "make linux", "make dos" or "make mac" and generate a necflash(.exe) file
